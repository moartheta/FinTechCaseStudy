## Overview and Origin

>* **Incorporated:**  2012
>
>* **Founders:**  Brad Katsuyama & Ronan Ryan
>
>* **Genesis of Business:** While working together on the global electronic trading team at Royal Bank of Canada, the founders discovered that the biggest stock exchanges were incentivizing predatory trading behaviour that was negatively impacting long-term, institutional investors that represented the savings of million of people.  The founders felt the best way to effect change was to create a new exchange where the interests of the investor came first.     
>
>* **Funding:** To date the company has raised $100.9M over 5 rounds of funding.  Its largest investors include Spark Capital and Sapphire Ventures along with smaller investments made by a diverse group of institutional market participants.
